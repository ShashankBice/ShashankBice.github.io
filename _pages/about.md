I was born and raised in Patna, India, a city located on the floodplains of River Ganges. The fact that the Ganges River receives a part of its summer flow from snow and ice melt in the mountains was my only connection to the mountains, before perusing cryospheric research as an undergrad :) I obtained a Integrated MSc. (Tech.) degree in Applied Geology from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad in 2018. While at IIT (ISM), I got an opportunity to work at the Applied Physics Lab, University of Washington (UW) as a student intern, where actually for the first time I saw glacier(s), mountain(s), and volcano in one go (Mt. Rainier). I returned to the UW as a graduate student in 2018. During graduate school, I worked at Planet Labs as a Photogrammetry Intern in 2020, just when the pandemic started :) Going forward, I am interested in expanding my knowledge on satellite remote sensing, and hope to pursue Earth Science research ideas which benefit people in the currently warming world!
