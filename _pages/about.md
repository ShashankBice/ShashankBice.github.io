Shashank Bhushan was born and raised in Patna, India, a city located on the floodplains of River Ganges. The fact that the Ganges River receives a part of its summer flow from snow and ice melt in the mountains was Shashank's only connection to the mountains, before perusing cryospheric research as an undergrad :) Shashank obtained a Integrated MSc. (Tech.) degree in Applied Geology from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad in 2018. While at IIT (ISM), he got an opportunity to work at the Applied Physics Lab, University of Washington as a student intern, where actually for the first time Shashank saw glacier(s), mountain(s), and volcano in one go (Mt. Rainier). He returned to the UW as a graduate student in 2018. Shashank has also worked at Planet Labs as a Photogrammetry Intern in 2020, just when the pandemic started :) Going forward, Shashank is interested in expanding his knowledge on satellite remote sensing, and hopes to pursue Earth Science research ideas which benefit people in the currently warming world!
